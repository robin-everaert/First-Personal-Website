# My First Personal Website :
This project is my first personal website.  
It is a solo project developed using the MVC method in PHP. Later, I specialized in JavaScript and Liquid.

I decided to keep this project in its original state without making any improvements, as I want it to remain as it was at the time.  
I know it is not perfect, but it is here on GitHub as a memory of my early steps.
